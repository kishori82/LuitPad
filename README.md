# LuitPad

LuitPad is a stand-alone, fully Unicode compliant software designed for rapid typing of Assamese words and characters based on 
approximate phonetic. 
There are two main typing options; one which is based on approximate sound of words and the other based on the sound of 
characters, both of which are efficient and user-friendly, even for a first-time user. There is a severe lack of user-friendly software 
available for typing Assamese text. Perhaps the underlying reason is it uses 1800+ conjunct characters, makes it extremely had to 
generate the text.
information storage and retrieval systems, both off-line and on-line. With LuitPad, the user can retrieve Assamese 
characters and words using an English alphabet based keyboard in an effective and intuitive way.​
​
LuitPad is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux with a GUI. The software is written in C++ in the Qt platform. The software can store the contents in LuitPad file 
format (“.pad” extension) that can store images and text. In addition, .pad files can be easily exported to pdf and html files.
